# PYQUEUE

PyQueue is a lightweight distributed task queue system for Python that uses Redis as a message broker. It allows you to define tasks with a simple decorator syntax and process them asynchronously using worker processes. Perfect for offloading heavy computations and long-running operations from your main application.
